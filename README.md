- **data**
  - directivity
    - bem - BEM results for the three different vehicles (pressure in frequency domain on 131st order Lebedev sphere)
    - sh - SH Coefficients for AVAS (SH order N=64) and tire/road noise radiation (N=16)
  - synthesis
    - coeffs - AVAS and tire/road noise synthesis coefficients, obtained by analyzing reference recordings

For consistency with the paper, we use the following aliases for the three evaluated vehicles:
- Vehicle A: Tesla Model Y 2021
- Vehicle B: Volkswagen ID.3 Pro Performance 2021
- Vehicle C: Nissan Leaf 2018


## External Dependencies
The toolbox requires the external function `getSH.m` (https://github.com/polarch/Spherical-Harmonic-Transform/blob/master/getSH.m) to generate SH basis functions.
Additionally, the script `generatePassBy.m` uses the HRTF set `HMSII.sofa` (https://sofacoustics.org/data/database/thk/HMSII.sofa), which you can alternatively replace with your own HRTF.

## Matlab Requirements
The code was tested for Matlab versions R2021b and newer. For full functionality, the following toolboxes are required:
- Audio Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- DSP System Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Measurement Data
Due to the GitHub file size limitations, all measurement data was uploaded to Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10610491). 
Please download the data manually and add the directories `ambience`, `avas`, `passby`, and `tires` to the `data/measurements` folder.
